				<p>
					Passionate student at the IESEG school of Management in Paris, I am in the first year of the Grande Ecole Program.I am a determined, enthusiastic, ambitious person and I attach great importance to cultural openness.My uniqueness comes from my international background. Indeed, I lived 6 years in Milan, allowing me to learn Italian that I now speak fluently, to discover a new culture, to prove my ability to adapt and to increase my openness.I also had the chance to spend an academic stay in England which allowed me to discover a different environment and society.I am a drawing enthusiast and I have been practicing art classes for 7 years now. I also love sports, running and tennis, every week alone or in a group.

				<h2>SPORTS üëü</h2>
				<p>Tennis enthusiast and member of the club de Borotra in Courbevoie. I have shared my passion for the sport with my father for over 10 years. Running is also a sport that I have been doing alone since this summer. Going to run 10km allows me to release the pressure, to concentrate on myself. This discipline makes me determined and brings me a lot of serenity. I have set myself a goal to achieve this year; I would like to participate in a half marathon, for the pleasure of exceeding my limits! I have participated in 4 races against hunger. Being a sporty person, I wanted to be able to use this quality to help people in need.</p>

				<h2>TRAVEL üó∫Ô∏è</h2>
				<p>The many trips I've been lucky enough to make have given me an international outlook. My life experience abroad has also enriched me! I went on a language trip to England 1.5 years ago. This experience has helped me become more independent and improved my level of English. </p>
